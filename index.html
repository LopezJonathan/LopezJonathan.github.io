            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Jonathan Lopez and I am currently enrolled in my fourth
                quarter at Cascadia College. In high school I was always trying to enroll
                myself in as many automotive and computer classes as allowed. I've always
                had an interest in building or repairing things, and loved technology. It
                was then that I learned I wanted to attain a career in Information
                Technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am half way to earning two degrees from two different colleges. The first
                degree being an AAS in Computer Security and Networking Technology from Lake
                Washington Institue of Technology. Second, an AAS in Web Applications
                Development with Mobile Emphasis from Cascadia College. My goal is to achieve
                these degrees and decide whether to further my education or apply what I've
                learned to a career in Information Technology.
                </P>
